![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d332af-f90d-4b6d-8750-4be07bc45161)

Recommendarr is a web application that generates personalized TV show and movie recommendations based on your Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, and Jellyfin libraries using AI.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: When accessing this application from outside your network, you must open port 3030 on your router/firewall.

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Get personalized TV show and movie suggestions based on your existing library
- **Sonarr & Radarr Integration**: Connects directly to your media servers to analyze your TV and movie collections
- **Plex, Jellyfin & Tautulli Integration**: Analyzes your watch history to provide better recommendations based on what you've actually watched
- **Flexible AI Support**: Works with OpenAI, local models (Ollama/LM Studio), or any OpenAI-compatible API
- **Customization Options**: Adjust recommendation count, model parameters, and more
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes based on your preference
- **Poster Images**: Displays media posters with fallback generation

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) instance with API access (for TV recommendations)
- [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) instance with API access (for movie recommendations)
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), or [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com/) instance with API access (for watch history analysis) - optional
- An OpenAI API key or any OpenAI-compatible API (like local LLM servers)
- Node.js (v14+) and npm for development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to run Recommendarr with all features is to use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository (which includes the docker-compose.yml file)
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git
cd recommendarr

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will:
1. Build the combined container with both frontend and API server
2. Configure proper networking and persistence
3. Start the unified service

Then visit `http://localhost:3030` in your browser to access the application.

The unified container runs both the frontend (on port 3030) and the API server (on port 3050 internally). This provides secure credential storage and proxy functionality for accessing services that may be blocked by CORS restrictions.

**Note:** If accessing from outside your network, remember to forward port 3030 on your router/firewall.

### Option 2: Docker (Manual Run)

You can also run the unified container manually:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -p 3050:3050 \
  -v $(pwd)/server/data:/app/server/data \
  tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3030` in your browser. The container includes both the frontend and API server for secure credential storage.

For more Docker options, see the [Docker Support](#-docker-support) section below.

### Option 3: Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git

```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run serve
```

4. Visit `http://localhost:3030` in your browser.

## 🐋 Docker Support

### Option 1: Pull and Run Pre-built Image

The easiest way to run Recommendarr:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -p 3050:3050 \
  -v $(pwd)/server/data:/app/server/data \
  tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
```

### Option 2: Build and Run Locally

If you want to build the Docker image yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd recommendarr

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t recommendarr:local .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -p 3050:3050 \
  -v $(pwd)/server/data:/app/server/data \
  recommendarr:local
```

### Option 3: Using Pre-built Docker Images

If you prefer not to build the image locally and want to use the pre-built image from Docker Hub:

```bash
# Create a new directory
mkdir recommendarr && cd recommendarr

# Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:
cat > docker-compose.yml << 'EOF'
version: '3'
services:
  recommendarr:
    image: tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
    container_name: recommendarr
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"
      - "3050:3050"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DOCKER_ENV=true
    volumes:
      - ./server/data:/app/server/data
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF

# Create the data directory
mkdir -p server/data

# Start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

This will pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub and start the unified service that includes both the frontend (port 3030) and API server (port 3050).

**Key benefits of using the Docker Compose method:**
- The data directory is mounted as a volume, ensuring your credentials persist across container restarts
- The frontend and API server are bundled together in a single container
- All your service credentials are stored securely using encryption
- CORS issues are automatically handled through the proxy service

**Note:** If you want to customize port mappings or other settings, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file before running the command.
